# Methodology: Canada Express Entry Analysis

## Data Collection Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

1. **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)**
   - Official Express Entry draw results
   - Published on the IRCC website
   - Includes date, CRS score cutoff, number of invitations, and program type

2. **Government of Canada Open Data Portal**
   - Historical immigration statistics
   - Supplementary demographic data
   - Policy change announcements

### Data Collection Process

1. **Web Scraping/Manual Collection**
   - Systematic collection of draw results from IRCC announcements
   - Verification against official press releases
   - Cross-referencing with historical archives

2. **Data Validation**
   - Comparison with multiple official sources
   - Identification and flagging of anomalies
   - Verification of date formats and numerical accuracy

3. **Data Standardization**
   - Consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Standardized program type classifications
   - Numerical data validation and cleaning

## Analytical Framework

### Key Metrics Analyzed

1. **Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Scores**
   - Minimum score required for invitation
   - Score distribution analysis
   - Trend analysis over time

2. **Draw Frequency**
   - Time intervals between draws
   - Seasonal patterns identification
   - Program-specific draw scheduling

3. **Invitation Volume**
   - Number of invitations per draw
   - Cumulative invitation tracking
   - Volume trend analysis

4. **Program Classification**
   - General draws (all programs)
   - Program-specific draws (CEC, FSW, etc.)
   - Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) integration

### Statistical Methods

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Mean, median, mode for CRS scores
   - Standard deviation and variance
   - Quartile analysis and percentiles

2. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Trend identification using moving averages
   - Seasonal decomposition
   - Autocorrelation analysis

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Year-over-year comparisons
   - Program-to-program comparisons
   - Pre/post policy change analysis

## Data Processing Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
```
Raw Data Sources → Data Collection → Initial Validation
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
```
Raw Data → Remove Duplicates → Standardize Formats → Validate Entries
```

### 3. Data Transformation
```
Clean Data → Calculate Metrics → Create Derived Fields → Aggregate Data
```

### 4. Analysis and Visualization
```
Processed Data → Statistical Analysis → Create Visualizations → Generate Insights
```

## Power BI Implementation

### Data Model Design

1. **Fact Tables**
   - Draw Results (main fact table)
   - Date dimension
   - Program dimension

2. **Calculated Measures**
   - Rolling averages for CRS scores
   - Year-over-year growth rates
   - Statistical distributions

3. **Relationships**
   - One-to-many relationships between dimensions and facts
   - Cross-filtering capabilities
   - Hierarchical date structures

### Visualization Strategy

1. **Time Series Charts**
   - Line charts for score trends
   - Area charts for invitation volumes
   - Combo charts for multiple metrics

2. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Histograms for score distributions
   - Box plots for statistical summaries
   - Scatter plots for correlation analysis

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Date range slicers
   - Program type filters
   - Drill-down capabilities

## Quality Assurance

### Data Quality Checks

1. **Completeness**
   - Verification of all expected draw dates
   - Identification of missing data points
   - Documentation of data gaps

2. **Accuracy**
   - Cross-validation with official sources
   - Mathematical validation of calculations
   - Peer review of analytical results

3. **Consistency**
   - Standardized data formats
   - Consistent categorization schemes
   - Uniform measurement units

### Validation Procedures

1. **Source Verification**
   - Multiple source confirmation
   - Official announcement validation
   - Historical record cross-checking

2. **Analytical Validation**
   - Statistical outlier detection
   - Logical consistency checks
   - Trend validation against known events

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Data Limitations

1. **Historical Data Availability**
   - Limited historical data before Express Entry launch (2015)
   - Potential gaps in early program data
   - Changes in reporting standards over time

2. **Data Granularity**
   - Aggregate data only (no individual applicant data)
   - Limited demographic breakdowns
   - No geographic distribution details

### Analytical Assumptions

1. **Trend Continuity**
   - Assumption that historical trends indicate future patterns
   - Policy changes may disrupt established trends
   - External factors may influence immigration patterns

2. **Data Representativeness**
   - Published data represents complete draw results
   - No significant unreported draws or corrections
   - Official sources provide accurate information

## Updates and Maintenance

### Data Refresh Schedule

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Weekly check for new draw announcements
   - Monthly comprehensive data validation
   - Quarterly analytical review

2. **Ad-hoc Updates**
   - Immediate updates for policy changes
   - Corrections for identified data errors
   - Emergency updates for significant events

### Version Control

1. **Data Versioning**
   - Timestamp all data updates
   - Maintain historical versions
   - Document all changes and sources

2. **Analysis Versioning**
   - Version control for Power BI file
   - Documentation of methodology changes
   - Backward compatibility considerations

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- No personal or identifying information included
- Aggregate data only
- Compliance with privacy regulations

### Data Usage
- Educational and research purposes only
- Proper attribution to data sources
- Respect for government data policies
